bulk-import-csv
===============

This code can be used to read a CSV file and import the contents in a database (in this example sqlite).

The example csv file has 3 columns and | as a seperator

CSV rows are inserted by blocks of ii rows.
In the example ii is set to 5.
On my machine 3000 was fastest.
So ii should be changed to 3000

1 milion rows can be inserted in 30 sec.
(icore 7, ssd's and 16G memory)
